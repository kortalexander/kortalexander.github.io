I’m a marine conservationist with a master’s degree in Environmental Science and Management from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara, where I specialized in Coastal Marine Resources Management. I most recently worked as Coral Data Manager for The Reef Institute, where I was responsible for overseeing all of the organization's data and grant reporting.

I'm passionate about protecting and restoring marine ecosystems worldwide for the benefit of the communities that rely on them. I have extensive experience in scientific data management and analysis (including spatial data), science communication (writing, social media, and film), education, and marine research techniques.

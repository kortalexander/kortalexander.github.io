# Education and Career Interests

I was born and raised in the great state of Texas, where my love of nature first took root. I graduated *summa cum laude* from Texas Tech University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and went on to earn a Master's in Environmental Science and Management from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara in 2023, specializing in Coastal Marine Resources Management

As a graduate student, I completed courses in everything from environmental law and economics to coastal policy and environmental media production, and developed skills in data analysis, science communication, and marine ecology. For my master's group project, I worked with Dr. Ben Halpern, Conservation International, and the Save the Waves Coalition to conduct an ecosystem service assessment of surf breaks in Brazil, using those findings to help prioritize sites for inclusion in marine protected areas.

After graduate school, I earned my PADI Divemaster certification and returned to the Turks and Caicos Islands—where I had studied abroad as an undergrad—to work as a Waterfront Assistant for The School for Field Studies. There, I shared my passion for the ocean and supported students in their development as marine scientists. Most recently, I served as Coral Data Manager for The Reef Institute in West Palm Beach, Florida, where I oversaw data systems and grant reporting for a restoration lab housing over 1,000 coral fragments across 20+ species.

Through diving, research, restoration, and outreach, I'm continually building the skills and perspective I hope to bring to future work with organizations dedicated to protecting and restoring our oceans.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, traveling, scuba diving, photography, and tennis. You can usually find me outdoors with Willow, my lovely blue heeler.
